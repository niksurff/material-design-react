# Material Design React

This project attempts to provide [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) Components wrapping Google's [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite) Components.

**This is just a brain dump and very much work in progress. Also I am committed to pushing this forward. If you'd like to contribute have a first look at the code. If you want to use the library maybe come back at a later time. Thanks.**


## Installation

`npm install --save material-design-react`

## Usage
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'material-design-react';
// or
// import Button from 'material-design-react/button';

let coloredButton = <Button colored ripple>I am Colored</Button>;
```
